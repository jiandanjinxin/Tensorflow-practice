##  Install TensorFlow version 1.3.0

This code requires **TensorFlow version 1.3**. Please choose the installation option that's right for you.

### 1. Install TensorFlow using Docker

This is the easiest option, but the largest download. It's recommended if you have difficulty using a virtual environment.
